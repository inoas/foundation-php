	 * Binding creates persistent variables anywhere you need them, without having to directly write and read from
	 * $_SESSION.
	 * 
	 * <code>
	 * $count = 0; // Initialization value for those with a new session (the default is null otherwise).
	 * $session = new Session();
	 * $session->bind('count', $count);
	 * $count++;
	 * echo $count; // Will output 1, 2, 3, 4 as you refresh the page.
	 * </code>
	 * 
	 * IMPORTANT: If you need to pass a session-bound variable, always pass by reference (i.e. "&"), otherwise you're
	 * passing only the current value (i.e. so then changing the value on the other side won't update the session). One
	 * exception to this rule is if the value in your variable is an object (ex. stdClass), which is always passed by 
	 * reference.
	 * 
	 * @param string $name
	 * A unique name used to store the data in the session. It can be convenient to use __CLASS__ and __METHOD__ (for
	 * factory methods) here as the name base in order to provide unique, intuitive names when you have to look at your
	 * session data and debug. Additional suffixes/prefixes (such as unique object instance identifiers) can be added to
	 * make the name unique as you need.
	 * 
	 * @param mixed $data
	 * The initial value of $data will be used to initialize the session store, if it doesn't already exist, otherwise
	 * the value in the session store will overwrite $data's value. After binding, any changes to the value of $data
	 * will be persisted in the session, without further method calls to this class (just re-bind on the next request).
